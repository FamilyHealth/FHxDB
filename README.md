# DOKBOT Database Structure


Thsi is an open-source FHx database built upon the HL7 pedigree model to store FHx information developed by Dr. Brandon Welch. This effort is a part of ItRunInMyFamily.com. The database consists of data collected as result of Dokbot's interaction with a patient. The database will be updated as the latest publication of AHIC Family health history model and the HL7 Pedigree model become available.
